/*
    eferences are often confused with pointers but three major differences between references and pointers are −

    You cannot have NULL references. You must always be able to assume that a reference is connected to a legitimate piece of storage.

    Once a reference is initialized to an object, it cannot be changed to refer to another object. Pointers can be pointed to another object at any time.

    A reference must be initialized when it is created. Pointers can be initialized at any time.
